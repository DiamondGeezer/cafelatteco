# Coffee Shop Website Spec (Jo’s-style template)

## Goal
Build a fast, modern, responsive marketing site for a coffee shop. The site should follow the structure, feel, and content patterns of https://www.joscoffee.com/ as a template (not a pixel-perfect clone). The repo must be suitable for deployment on GitHub Pages with a CNAME file for the paid custom domain.

## Non-Goals (for MVP)
- No user accounts
- No online payments on this site
- No Clover integration yet (ordering will be a link-out CTA for now)
- No CMS required (content stored in simple JSON files)

## Tech/Repo Requirements
- Static site that works on GitHub Pages.
- Plain HTML/CSS/JS OR a static build framework (acceptable: Astro / Next.js static export / Vite).
- No server-side rendering required.
- All site content (locations, hours, announcements, events) must be editable via JSON in `/src/data/`.
- Output must be accessible (semantic HTML, keyboard nav, alt text), responsive, and fast.

## Repository & GitHub Pages Publishing Assumptions (IMPORTANT)
- Codex must work within the existing Git repository for this project and must not initialize a new repository.
- The canonical repository is: https://github.com/DiamondGeezer/cafelatteco
- Default branch is `main`.
- The site must be publishable via GitHub Pages from the `main` branch.
- Prefer a structure that publishes from the repository root (i.e., the published output includes an `index.html` at the root of the publish source).
- Use relative paths suitable for project pages (the site may be served under a subpath like `/cafelatteco/`).
- All built assets (HTML, CSS, JS, images, fonts) must work correctly when served from the project subpath `https://diamondgeezer.github.io/cafelatteco/`.
- Include an empty `.nojekyll` file at the publish root to prevent Jekyll processing issues.

## Deployment Requirements
- Repo supports GitHub Pages publishing.
- Include `/CNAME` file (domain placeholder: `www.REPLACE_WITH_DOMAIN.com`).
- Use relative paths suitable for GitHub Pages.
- Provide a short `DEPLOY.md` that explains:
  - how to run locally
  - how to build
  - how GitHub Pages publishes
  - where to set the custom domain + HTTPS

## Information Architecture / Sitemap
Top navigation (desktop + mobile hamburger):
- Home: `/`
- About: `/about`
- Locations: `/locations`

- Order: `/order`

Footer:

## Content/Data Model

### `locations.json`
Array of locations:
- id
- slug

- status: open|comingSoon
- hoursShort
- hoursLong (optional)
- addressLines (array)
- phone (optional)
- links:
  - menuUrl (optional)

- primaryCtaHref
- shopHref
- social:
  - instagram
  - facebook
- seo defaults

## Visual Design (Jo’s-inspired)
- Minimal, bold typography
- Strong all-caps headings
- Lots of whitespace
- Large photography
- Simple buttons with strong contrast
- Mobile-first with clean nav + overlay menu

## Fonts (LOCAL SELF-HOSTED — REQUIRED)

A custom brand font is provided and must be self-hosted locally.

Source font file:
- `/assets/fonts/CafeLatteCoFont.woff`

Codex MUST perform the following steps:
1. Preserve the original `.woff` file.
2. Transcode `CafeLatteCoFont.woff` into `CafeLatteCoFont.woff2`.
3. Output the `.woff2` file to `/assets/fonts/`.
4. Commit both font files to the repository.
5. Do not hotlink or reference any external font providers.

Preferred transcoding method (if CLI tools are available):
- Run `woff2_compress CafeLatteCoFont.woff`.

If CLI tools are unavailable, use a build-step or programmatic method that produces a valid `.woff2` file.

Final expected folder structure:
- `/assets/fonts/CafeLatteCoFont.woff`
- `/assets/fonts/CafeLatteCoFont.woff2`

Register the font in the global stylesheet using `@font-face`:
- font-family: `CafeLatteCo`
- font-weight: 400
- font-style: normal
- font-display: swap
- source order must prefer `.woff2` first, then `.woff`

Fonts must be wired exclusively via CSS variables:
- `--font-display` for headings
- `--font-body` for body text

Both variables must reference the `CafeLatteCo` font and include system font fallbacks.

No hardcoded `font-family` declarations are allowed outside these variables.

## Images
- Use modern formats where possible (WebP/AVIF), fall back to JPG.
- Optimize size for fast load.
- Provide alt text.

## SEO
- Unique title + meta description per page.
- OpenGraph tags default in layout with overrides per page.
- Sitemap.xml (optional but recommended).
- robots.txt basic.

## Deliverables
- Full site implementation with all pages above
- JSON-driven content
- `CNAME` placeholder file
- `DEPLOY.md`
- Clean, readable code and folder structure

## Future Hook (Phase 2)
- Add “Order Ahead” integration (Clover/third-party) via `/order` page links first.
- Later: build a real ordering flow + backend (Parse/Back4App) + Clover API integration and printing.
